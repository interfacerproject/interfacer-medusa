# Test the first slice locally

## One command

From this directory, with Docker running, **Node 24.19.0 / npm 11.17.0** (tested) and Python 3 installed:

```bash
npm test
```

No git, Compose, Redis, external Interfacer service, or payment credentials required. First install needs npm registry access; Docker needs `postgres:15-alpine`. Allow ~1 GB for dependencies/cache. Ports **55432** (Postgres) and **19000** (brief health probe) must be free.

This command starts/creates only the labeled `interfacer-medusa-spike-db` container, installs the locked dependencies if needed, typechecks, migrates, executes real Medusa workflows against Postgres, and briefly boots Medusa **2.10.3**. It prints the product/variant IDs and immutable binding, then stops the server process group and its DB container, even on test failure. Data is retained in the stopped container. Do not run it concurrently with an interactive server using this DB.

Expected ending:

```text
ALL SPIKE CHECKS PASSED (fixture controller seam; not live PDP proof)
PASS live Medusa GET /health: 200 OK
PASS finished; HTTP server and spike DB stopped (data retained).
```

On a fresh DB, the test deliberately throws **after the product workflow commits but before the mapping is saved**, then recovers that product under four concurrent retries. Subsequent runs report that fresh-DB injection was skipped and verify the same IDs. No extra product is created.

## Interactive: see the running server, projection, and mapping

Terminal 1, from this directory:

```bash
npm run setup       # npm ci (as needed), typecheck, DB migration
npm start           # foreground Medusa at http://127.0.0.1:9000
```

Terminal 2, same directory:

```bash
curl --fail http://127.0.0.1:9000/health
npm run project
npm run inspect
npm run project     # same binding/product/variant IDs; "created": false
```

`project` invokes `medusa exec ./src/scripts/project.ts` in `medusa/`. It loads the app's **interfacer module** and calls the supported **createProductsWorkflow**; this is not a mock product or direct SQL core-table insertion. `inspect` queries that module plus the native Product module and prints the stored draft and its one variant. The admin UI is deliberately disabled; no admin build or admin login is needed.

A draft has no prices, channels, shipping allocation, or sellable inventory. `manage_inventory: false` is intentional for this **unpublished, non-purchasable spike**, not a claim of unlimited stock. The source quantity is never copied.

Optional read-only SQL observation (DB must be running):

```bash
docker exec interfacer-medusa-spike-db psql -U medusa -d interfacer_medusa -c \
'SELECT b.id AS binding, b.catalog_resource_id, b.source_dpp_id, p.id AS product, p.status, v.id AS variant, b.source_snapshot_hash, b.passport_snapshot_hash FROM interfacer_listing_binding b JOIN product p ON p.id = b.medusa_product_id JOIN product_variant v ON v.id = b.medusa_variant_id;'
```

When finished: **Ctrl-C** in terminal 1, then `npm run stop`. Nothing else in Docker is stopped.

## Authorization: explicit local stub, not cryptographic proof

`medusa/src/modules/interfacer/fixture-controller-check.ts` is the deliberately named **fixture controller seam**. Root `project`/`test` scripts explicitly enable `INTERFACER_AUTH_MODE=fixture-controller-stub`. It compares a locally asserted Person with the resource fixture's `primaryAccountable.id`. Only that controller is allowed; seller eligibility is NOT an additional gate.

This models a PDP-returned controller attestation; it does **not prove possession of a registered key**. Anyone with local shell/DB access can impersonate the fixture Person. It is not suitable for network clients or deployment. There is **no HTTP listing-write endpoint**, no header identity support, no IdentityLink, and no fake Zenroom signature format. Direct `medusa exec` without opt-in fails closed; fixture mode is also rejected under `NODE_ENV=production`.

Demonstrate rejection (after setup; expect nonzero exit and no new rows):

```bash
INTERFACER_FIXTURE_PERSON=some-other-person npm run project
npm run stop
```

Acceptance tests also cover forged subject/header-like claims, mismatched DPP parent, simulated PDP failure, unsupported obligations, disabled seam, production guard, changed source/DPP hashes, concurrent retries, metadata tampering, and immutable rows. These are **seam tests**, not evidence of real PDP transport, real header handling, or cryptographic compatibility.

Live Zenflows/DPP integration is **BLOCKED/deferred**: sibling worktrees/commits were not inspected under the task constraints; no compatible commerce policy or signed-envelope transport is assumed. Next production step is authoritative remote resource reads plus registered-key verification, action/audience/body binding, nonce replay protection and online fail-closed controller decisions. Do not expose the CLI seam through a route.

## Inputs and authority

- `docs/fixtures/economic-resource.json`: synthetic resource with name and controller.
- `docs/fixtures/dpp.json`: synthetic passport with its own `ID` and matching `ProductID`. No fixtures existed initially.
- Title is projected; product metadata contains **only resource ID, DPP ID and projection-intent ID**. No passport sections, attachments, status, raw JSON or URLs are exposed. Passport ID is the reference; hashes stay in the module.
- `interfacer_projection_intent` durably fixes the resource, passport, controller, canonical JSON SHA-256 hashes and deterministic product handle **before** creation.
- `interfacer_listing_binding` stores product + variant IDs, original references, hashes and fixture policy evidence. Both tables belong to the integration module. DB triggers reject UPDATE/DELETE (including soft-delete), not just hidden UI fields.
- Idempotency key: SHA-256 of `["interfacer-local-v1", resource.id, "default"]`. One instance and one configuration per resource only. Reordered object keys hash identically; arrays retain order. Changing fixture content is a conflict, not an implicit refresh/rebind.
- Product metadata is not the mapping authority. Editing it cannot rebind the record; a retry with a changed reference requires reconciliation.
- Postgres advisory lock serializes the projection across processes. Unique source/product/variant keys are an additional safeguard. The native in-memory event bus/workflow engine is not used as a durability promise.

## Limits and recovery

Recovery after the **completed** product workflow/lost response was tested. If a hard process kill interrupts the workflow before it has created the variant, retry detects the incomplete product and raises `reconciliation_required`; it does not create a second product to hide it. This is not a complete saga/reconciliation UI. Do not manually rename/delete an in-flight projection's deterministic product handle; discovery of that orphan relies on it. Do not enable normal admin editing or production publishing for these demo products.

No signed HTTP operation, durable message worker, IdentityLink, stock allocation, purchase, live refresh, price, publication, payment, ledger write, or DPP/Zenflows mutation is implemented. Custom link/auth/cart/payment extension points in `docs/phase0-findings.md` were source-inspected, not end-to-end checkout-tested. Admin build was intentionally not attempted. Older pinned dependencies emit deprecation warnings; this is a local spike, not a security-reviewed deployment.

## DB and troubleshooting

Default connection: `postgres://medusa:medusa_local@127.0.0.1:55432/interfacer_medusa`.
Container label: `interfacer.medusa.spike=true`. Credentials are local demo credentials, bound to loopback. Data lives in the container writable layer, **not** in sibling projects or a shared DB.

`DATABASE_URL` may select another database **you create in this spike container**; scripts still start/stop this container. The checked-in `medusa/.env.example` documents defaults. Root scripts use the environment URL or the documented default rather than an edited .env URL.

- Probe details: `.tmp/server-probe.log`.
- Cache/temp/config files are confined to `.cache/` and `.tmp/`, ignored with dependencies and `medusa/.env`.
- To force a dependency reinstall: remove `.tmp/dependencies.hash`, then `npm run setup`.
- Port conflict: stop your other server on 19000/9000; never stop unrelated DB containers. Existing port 5432 is not used.
- To rerun the fresh-DB recovery test without destroying the sample database:

```bash
npm run setup
docker exec interfacer-medusa-spike-db createdb -U medusa interfacer_medusa_fresh_test
DATABASE_URL=postgres://medusa:medusa_local@127.0.0.1:55432/interfacer_medusa_fresh_test npm test
```

Use a new DB name each time; the test never drops data. During implementation, `interfacer_medusa_acceptance` was used for the recorded cold-DB test. Normal commands use `interfacer_medusa`.

See `docs/phase0-findings.md` for exact source/API evidence and `docs/phase0-STATUS.md` for handoff status.
